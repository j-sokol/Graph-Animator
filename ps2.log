    ps2.sh, version 1

    Bash script that creates a .mp4 animation from source (sources) of data - URLs or files. 
    Input data in files are in format "Date [ws] float value", eg. "[2009/05/11 07:33:00] 5".
    Script depends on gnuplot, wget and ffmpeg.        
    Uses gnuplot for creating each frame in animation and then ffmpeg for combining frames into animation.
